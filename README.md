# Project Title: AquaHarvest

# Project Description:

Our project AquaHarvest was constructed as an instance of the AgroTech Domain.  Given the abundance of technical deliverables in the field of dry agriculture, our team has worked on the implementation of a product in the domain of Pisciculture, a field of marine agriculture.

# Problem Statement:
Despite its augmenting significance and contribution in the fields of revenue, income and cultivation-production cycle, aquaculture as a whole has rarely been addressed as problem worth solving. Hence, our project aims to remedy this deficit by constructing a portal backed up by AI which solves a pisciculturist’s doubts and queries regarding their fish farms, species, conditions of breeding, probable profits and the like. 
Therefore, our product can be viewed as prospective business model which can be utilized by the users as a reference for their cultivation-production platform. It also bridges the gap between a dealer and a farmer for the ease of translation of information and recommendations as provided by our website. 

# Outreach of the Project:
Our project observes the implementation of a website, named as AquaHarvest, that caters to two types of users:

i. Fish breeders and dealers, who will benefit from our services when they require statistics and information regarding the breed of fish they want to cultivate, and associated requirements and conditions for the same. They will be given professional guidance about the procedures they must follow to ensure proper cultivation and they will also be apprised of the probable profits and expenses. 

ii. Enthusiasts, who would like to explore the domain itself and gather knowledge about the same. 

# Important Technical components of the Project:

Our webpage has made use of the following techstack:

1. JavaScript, ExpressJS and NodeJS, which have been leveraged to script the website and employ server side rendering as well as for building the user interface. NodeJS has been specifically exploited for client side and server side development. EJS or Embedded JS has been used to create dynamic pages, as shown in the link for the website. 

2. MongoDB Atlas has been used to deploy the database on the Google Cloud platform.

An aggregate of two machine learning models have been implemented in the project:
1. Fish Species Detection Model:

The model identifies the species of the fish as per the image that has been uploaded by the user. This gives the cultivator a background on the fish type and associated characteristics of the same. We have implemented the first part of the above statement with the use of python libraries such as pandas, numpy and sklearn. It also uses Pickle module, to save the machine learning model in a disk and vice versa. 
Once the user uploads an image of the fish, we will be able to identify it using the ML model and on the basis of future datasets, predict further information about it. 

2. Fish Disease Detection Model:

While this model hasn’t completed an error-free execution yet, the disease detection model aims to gauge whether or not a fish is sporting any disease and predicts its consequent effects on the breeding grounds and neighbor species. This disease detection model employs Python based machine learning modules such as:

i. Numpy

ii. Pandas

iii. Scikit-image

iv. OpenCV

v. Procfile

vi. Scikit-learn

vii. Flask

The KMeans algorithm, which is an unsupervised learning algorithm has been utilized for clustering the fish images into different categories based on their features. 

An integration of all these modules is expected to help the product estimate as to whether the school of fishes are sporting any disease, any suggest prevention and control methods for the same.
